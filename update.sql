# You can use this update file to modify database
# structure if you don't want full reinstall.

# revision 250, you must apply every update query
# like revision 105, revision 140, revision 180
# revision 198, revision 202, etc.

# Revision 460 (adding avatar support)
ALTER TABLE `users` ADD `avatar_filename` VARCHAR( 36 ) NOT NULL COMMENT 'avatar picture filename';

# Revision 491 (making root user's userlevel 4 instead of 5)
